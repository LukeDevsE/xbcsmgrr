*A quickly written application to easily interact with Xbox Live game save data.*


### Preview

## How to login
1. press the Open Link button on the dialog when you open the program.
2. Click authorize
3. enter the code after ?code= and press Ok
4. you are now logged into xbcsmgrr (anytime you close it, you will have to log back in)

## Requirements
- Windows (wine on linux might work too)
- an internet connection
- Any game that uses Xbox Live (*installed and played recently*)

## Known working games (as in games you can download save files from)
- UNDERTALE (possibly DELTARUNE)
- Minecraft: Xbox One Edition
- Slime Rancher
- HITMAN 3

Basically any singleplayer game

## Background
Accessing games using Xbox Live's save data requires authorization for the 'TitleStorage' service. This requires a user token. I created this application to make the process more clean and easier.

## Why?
I believe that everyone has the right to access their game save data on the games that they play. (if you no longer own a game, you can transfer your save files to your pc)
